# EELE465_Theia
* Welcome to the new repo for the rest of the semester! 
* tagging a version of your code before moving on is helpful to save all of the versions and submit to D2L later
* If using CCS Theia (it's cool), you currently have to create the blinking light LED example and then clear that code out of there. I know it's annoying not to have the empty project or template built, but Theia is new, and it will come one day. 
* Update the .gitignore as needed. 
  using the syntax **/directory to be ignored/* is particularly helpful for this. 
* We have project folders and a folder for subroutines and functions. Don't worry about the subroutines folder if you don't have time to update it. 
* For git help, language model AI like chatgpt is very helpful.
